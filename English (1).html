<p><strong>What is programming?</strong></p>
<p>Programming, also known as “coding” is the assembling of tasks or commands to a computer to form a program. Computer here does not only refer to your Personal Computer or Laptop but also refers to any device that can execute a program such as an ATM, Grocery Scanner, Play Station, Xbox, Mobile Phones, Smart TV etc.</p>
<p>With programming, we can build what are called “computer programs” like Computer Games, Web Applications <em>(Facebook, Twitter, etc.)</em>, Mobile applications and many more.</p>
<p>Confused?</p>
<p>Imagine a computer as an obedient pet dog, let’s name our dog “fifo”. We can command fifo to do different tasks. Now remember our fifo is not as smart as human, he is less logical thus needs to be trained in a detailed manner and we have to be very specific.</p>
<p>Let’s teach our pet how to make rice.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, we have to teach him how to prepare the materials required for the tasks. In this case, a rice cooker.</li>
<li>Second, we have to teach him how to transfer the rice from a container to the pot.</li>
<li>Third, he needs to learn now to rinse the rise several times then leave water after.</li>
<li>Lastly, we need to teach him how to put the pot back to the rice cooker and press the “cook” button.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a pseudocode to show how this program would look like. Pseudocode refers to a readable and detailed description of steps a program will follow. It is not an actual program.</p>
<pre><code>Program FifoMakesRice
    
        : prepareMaterials_IsThereRiceCooker?
            ifThereIsRiceCooker
                thereIsRiceCooker
			ifThereIsNone 
                thereIsNoRiceCooker

	    : transferTheRice_IsItTransferred?
			ifThereIsRice
			    transfer
				itIsTransferred
			ifThereIsNone
			    thereIsNoRice
			    itIsNotTransferred

		: washSeveralTimes_5_Times
			1. washRice
			2. washRice
			3. washRice
			4. washRice
			5. washRice

	    : putOnTheRiceCooker_ThenCook
	       putRice
	       pressCookButton
		

  :::start program:::
  
	    : prepareMaterials_IsThereRiceCooker?
		    : ifThereIsRiceCooker
	    		: transferTheRice_IsItTransferred?
    		        : itIsTransferred
		                 : washSeveralTimes_5_Times
		                 : putOnTheRiceCooker_ThenCook
		                 
 :::end program:::
</code></pre>
<p>We taught our pet how to make rice by building the steps from 1 to 4 above, that is essentially “programming” . If we assemble those 4 steps, we can form a program.</p>
